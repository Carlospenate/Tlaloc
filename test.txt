        define algo as integer.
        define a as integer.
        define b as integer.
        define i as integer = 0.

			for a = 0 to 9 step 1:

			      arr[a] = i.
            printline(i).
            i = i + 1. 

		  end for  

			for a = 0 to 9 step 1:


            printline(arr[a]).
            i = i + 1. 

		  end for
