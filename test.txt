program edo:

	method void main():
        define arr as integer [10].
        define mat as integer [10,12].
        define algo as integer.
        define a as integer.
        define b as integer.
        define i as integer = 0.

			for a = 0 to 9 step 1:
			  for b = 0 to 11 step 1:
			      mat[a,b] = i.
            i = i + 1.
            printline(mat[a,b]).
		    end for
		  end for

			for a = 0 to 9 step 1:
